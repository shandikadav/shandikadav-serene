## About Me

I’m an Informatics student at **Amikom University Yogyakarta** who lives at the intersection of **mobile development**, **music**, **and a bit of anime energy**. By day (and sometimes late at night), I work as an **Android Developer**, turning ideas into polished mobile experiences.

I love building apps with **Flutter** to create smooth cross-platform journeys and using **Jetpack Compose** to craft modern, high-performance Android UIs. These days, my playlist—and my tech stack—are evolving as I explore the **Apple ecosystem**, learning **Swift** and backend development with **Vapor**.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me vibing to **AZKi**, **watching anime**, or **debugging life** while thinking about better architecture and cleaner code. I believe great software is like good music: well-structured, expressive, and meant to be enjoyed.

## Writing & Social

**A Developer's Logbook.**<br>
My coding adventures in Flutter and Jetpack Compose. Filled with code, chaos, and hard-won lessons along the way.

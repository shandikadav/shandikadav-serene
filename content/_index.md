## About Me

I’m an Informatics student at **Amikom University Yogyakarta** and a mobile developer focused on building clean, well-structured apps.

Currently part of the **Apple Developer Academy @ UC Jakarta — Cohort 2026**, I’m expanding into the Apple ecosystem with **Swift**, **Vapor**, and soon **SwiftUI** for iOS development.

My background includes Android (Jetpack Compose) and Flutter, with a strong interest in clean architecture and scalable systems.

I daily drive Linux (Fedora KDE), enjoy working close to the system, and treat both personal projects and community infrastructure with production-level thinking.

Outside of code, I build **NUMI** — a gaming community evolving into a brand — while continuously exploring better ways to design, build, and ship software.

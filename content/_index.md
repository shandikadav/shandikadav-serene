## About Me

An Anime, Music, and Cloud Computing enthusiast. I'm an Informatics student at Amikom University Yogyakarta who transforms into an **Android Developer** by day (and sometimes by night).

My passion is to craft exceptional mobile applications, whether it's using **Flutter** to build magical cross-platform experiences or with **Jetpack Compose** to assemble modern, high-performance native Android UIs.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably trying to debug life or dreaming of deploying code from an isekai.

## Writing & Social

**A Developer's Logbook.**<br>
My coding adventures in Flutter and Jetpack Compose. Filled with code, chaos, and hard-won lessons along the way.

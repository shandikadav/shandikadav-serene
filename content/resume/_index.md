## About
I’m an Informatics student at Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta with a strong passion for mobile development and cloud technology. Currently, I’m actively working as a **Flutter developer**, building modern, cross-platform applications that focus on performance, usability, and accessibility.

With hands-on experience in Flutter and familiarity with cloud services like **Google Cloud Platform**—including Compute Engine and Cloud Run—I aim to build scalable, seamless solutions that bridge mobile and cloud ecosystems.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my skills to real-world challenges, learn from others, and contribute to impactful projects. Outside of code, I value clear communication, critical thinking, and a growth mindset—qualities that help me adapt, lead, and continuously improve.

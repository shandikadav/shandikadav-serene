## About
I am a passionate Mobile Developer dedicated to building applications that are not just functional, but also provide an exceptional user experience through intuitive design and clean code.

To bring this vision to life, I specialize in the modern Android development landscape. I use Flutter for its power in creating beautiful, consistent cross-platform applications, and I dive deep into Jetpack Compose to build fluid, high-performance native UIs that feel truly at home on Android.

As an Informatics student at Universitas AMIKOM Yogyakarta, I am eager to apply my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges. I am looking for opportunities to collaborate with innovative teams and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of mobile technology.

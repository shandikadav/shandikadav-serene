## About
I am a Mobile Developer focused on building clean, scalable, and well-structured applications. I care deeply about thoughtful architecture, maintainable systems, and creating products that feel intentional.

Currently part of the **Apple Developer Academy @ UC Jakarta — Cohort 2026**, I am expanding into the Apple ecosystem with **Swift**, backend development using **Vapor**, and preparing to build iOS applications with **SwiftUI**.

My foundation comes from modern Android development using **Jetpack Compose**, along with cross-platform development using **Flutter**. Beyond mobile, I am interested in system design and backend architecture, constantly refining how I think about software at scale.

I daily drive Linux (Fedora KDE), which shapes how I approach tooling, workflows, and infrastructure. Outside of personal development, I am also the founder of **NUMI Community**, a gaming community evolving into a brand, where I explore leadership, collaboration, and technical infrastructure.

## About
As a passionate **Android Developer**, I focus on designing and building mobile applications that deliver an exceptional user experience through clean code and solid architecture. I am currently an Informatics student at Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta.

My expertise is centered on two modern approaches: cross-platform development using **Flutter** and native development with **Jetpack Compose**. This expertise is supported by an understanding of cloud services to ensure connected and reliable applications. I thrive in collaborative environments, applying critical thinking to continuously learn and contribute to impactful projects.
